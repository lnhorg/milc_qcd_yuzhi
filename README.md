MILC collaboration code for lattice QCD calculations

The MILC Code is a body of high performance research software written
in C (with some C++) for doing SU(3) lattice gauge theory on high
performance computers as well as single-processor workstations.  A
wide variety of applications are included.  See NEWS for recent
important changes.
