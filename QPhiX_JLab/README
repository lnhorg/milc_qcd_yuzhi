These are instructions for downloading and building the JLab QPhiX
package ("devel" branch) for clover solves.

Check paths defined at the top of ./build.sh

Then run 

   ./build.sh

It may be necessary to edit some of the cmake parameters

cd build
ccmake ../qphix

On Cray systems, use CC = cc and CXX = CC.  Also, be sure the modules
include compiler, architecture (KNL), and MPI support.  For example,

PrgEnv-intel/6.0.4 
craype-mic-knl 
cray-mpich/7.6.2
