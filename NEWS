Update ks_eigen to Version 7 standards.  Modify input parameters files.
See the ks_eigen/test directory for examples of the new format.

2018-04-12      commit 3f56829 
===========================================================================
With a series of commits we now set the time boundary condition globally
and use the coordinate origin uniformly to set the location of the boundary.

We also now implement deflation by default in the staggered inverter
if eigenvectors are supplied

These changes require changes in the parameter inputs. In ks_spectrum
and clover_invert2 applications, the time_bc line is removed from
propagator stanzas and appears together with the coordinate_origin
line at the top.  In ks_spectrum and ks_measure applications a
max_number_of_eigenpairs line must be inserted before the
number_of_pbp_masses line.  I/O specifications must follow if the
desired number is nonzero.
